perusal of ⁴the First Book of Metamorphoses.
This coincidence might perhaps be otherwise
explained, hythe supposition, that the ancient
Greeks and AEgyptians merely adopted general
traditione which had deseended from remote
antiquity, and being little acquainted with the
world at large, applied them to particular cira
cumstances of their own country. Before the
invention of writiug, universal tradition was con-
stantly liable to perversiori from the appropriatione '
of natural simplicity or uatioual pride. And
perhaps it is more wonderful that the leading
characters of each important event should have
been preserved, through so many ages, by means
of oral tradition, than that the universal deluge
should be represented by Herodotus as an inunda-
tion confined to the country of Thessaly 3 or
that the presumptuous building of the tower of

Babel should be recorded iu poetry as the piling
of mount Pelion on mount Ossa, by the hands
of rebellione giants.
